# - Bash itself cannot recognize Regular Expressions
# - Bash carries out filename expansion, a process known as globbing

# list all files which do not start with a . in cwd
ls *

# list all files starting with a(...)b(...)c in cwd
ls a*b*c

# list all files a-X.py, where 'X' is an arbitrary single char
ls a-?.py

# list all files starting with either a or b
ls [ab]*

# list all files starting with chars between a to c
ls [a-c]*
